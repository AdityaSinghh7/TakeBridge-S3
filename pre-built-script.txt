From the filtered results, pick the first viable itinerary and click through to open the “Book” link on the airline’s own site in a new tab (do not choose OTAs).

python scripts/orchestrate_task.py --task "Triage every saved email (.eml) into a single CSV log. Inputs: email foldername -tickets and it's path -  /home/user/Desktop/tickets; output CSV filename- triage_results.csv and it's path - /home/user/takebridge_demo/triage/triage_results.csv. If the CSV doesn’t exist, create it with this exact header: id,received_at,from,subject,priority,category,assignee,sla_due,notes. Process: open the folder tickets that is at path - /home/user/Desktop/tickets in the file manager, and handle only .eml files. For each email, open it, then capture: id = filename without extension (e.g., TKT-001), received_at = Date header converted to ISO 8601 with timezone (if missing/unreadable, use the file’s last‑modified time in local timezone), from = sender email address only (strip display name), subject = as shown (trim outer whitespace), priority/category/assignee/sla_due = leave blank, notes = a concise 8–12 word summary from the first lines of the body (skip obvious greetings/signatures; avoid PII). Open /home/user/takebridge_demo/triage/triage_results.csv in LibreOffice Calc and append one row per email; do not reorder existing rows; save after 2 rows. Edge cases: if an id already exists, append a new row using id-dup2, id-dup3, etc.; if an email can’t be opened, add a row with id and notes = unreadable eml and continue. Completion: save the CSV and report only the total count of emails processed."


python scripts/orchestrate_task.py --task "Open LibreOffice Calc and load `~/takebridge_demo/hr_onboarding/new_hires.csv`. For each row, create a folder at `~/takebridge_demo/hr_onboarding/onboarding/{{last}}{{first}}/`, copy the checklist template from `~/takebridge_demo/hr_onboarding/onboarding_checklist.odt` into that folder as `checklist.odt`, open it in LibreOffice Writer, and replace every token (`{{first}}`, `{{last}}`, `{{start_date}}`, `{{manager}}`) with the employee’s data; save. Next, open Thunderbird, compose a new message using the body from `~/takebridge_demo/hr_onboarding/welcome_email.txt`, replace the same tokens, address it to the hire’s `email` from the CSV, CC the manager, attach the personalized checklist (ODT or PDF), and send. If the role requires access provisioning, copy `~/takebridge_demo/hr_onboarding/account_request.txt` into the hire’s folder as `account_request.txt`, fill in `{{first}}`, `{{last}}`, `{{start_date}}`, `{{role}}`, `{{manager}}`, and `{{location}}`, and send it to IT. Finally, open or create `~/takebridge_demo/onboarding/onboarding_tracker.csv` and record for each hire whether documents were sent, whether accounts were requested, and whether onboarding is completed, adding short notes with dates or pending actions."
